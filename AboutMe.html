									<p>Recent graduate ‘20 in Computer Science & Physics from the liberal arts education program at Knox College, I am working on a double major in computer science and physics. I believe that in life we place marks; dots that represent milestones in each journey. People aspire to contribute towards humanity or to become rich and/or famous, or simply to be satisfied and happy. Different types of hopes and dreams make humankind so unique. In contrast, no matter how dissimilar we might seem to one another we live in a universe constructed by stringent constants. An object falls at 9.81…m/s. If even the insignificant digits change then it might have drastic consequences on how life exists. We live with our differences in a delicate but rigorously constructed universe indeed!</p>
									<p>Even though electrons might be able to trick us by their wave or particle-like nature, we can still predict the probability of their position. The aspect of probability or prediction is what I am truly interested in. If we can predict the probability of insignificant microscopic particles and significant huge universal objects (bounded by constants) then I do believe that our “differences” as humans could have a pattern in how we live our lives.</p>
									<p>I have waited for my dots to connect. I found out that the data science/machine learning discipline fits my criteria perfectly as I can use the analysis from physics and programming experience from computer science to produce insightful outcomes. With 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being created each day, mining, analyzing, and predicting outcomes and possibilities could not be more enthralling.</p>
									<p>As someone who is very enthusiastic about probability and prediction, I truly believe that machine learning can be used to contribute towards the betterment of humankind. Who knows we might be able to formulate a systematic model on how the world along with humankind function? I one day hope to be a data scientist dedicated to social change: whether it be for the environment, preventing data-driven attacks, or even predicting the next big earthquake to save lives in my home country Nepal.</p>
